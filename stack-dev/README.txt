- Vanilla JavaScript (assets/js/main.js)

How to run
- Open index.html in a browser.

Customization
- Colors and fonts are managed via CSS variables in assets/css/style.css (:root).
- Update your name, email, social links, and project entries directly in index.html.
- Replace avatar: assets/images/avatar.svg (you can swap with png/jpg and update the src).

Notes
- Bootstrap Icons are loaded via CDN.
- Placeholder local files exist at:
  - assets/css/bootstrap.min.css
  - assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js
  These are not used by default because the template uses the Bootstrap 5 CDN.
